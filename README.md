Water Tricorder
===============

Approximately 2 billion people around the world are affected by poor water
quality.

This is a low cost opensource device for quickly and reliably answering the question: "can I drink this water?" It uses spectrometry for measuring toxic inorganic compounds and microscopy for sensing concentrations of harmful microorganisms. Both systems coordinate with on-device machine learning for instant readings.
