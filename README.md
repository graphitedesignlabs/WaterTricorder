WaterTricorder
==============

Approximately 2 billion people around the world are affected by poor water
quality.

A low cost opensource device for quickly and reliably answering the question: "can I drink this water?" It uses spectrometry for measuring toxic inorganic compounds and microscopy for sensing concentrations of harmful microorganisms. Both systems use on-device machine learning for instant readings. 

Currently at an early stage of development. Read the [design notes](DESIGN-NOTES.md) and join the project.
