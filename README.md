WaterTricorder
==============

A low cost opensource device for quickly and reliably answering the question: "can I drink this water?" It uses spectrometry for measuring toxic inorganic compounds and microscopy for measuring harmful microorganisms. Both systems use on-device machine learning for instant readings. 

Currently at the early stage of development. Read the [design notes](DESIGN-NOTES.md) and join the project.
